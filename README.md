# HelloTask
HelloTask is a project management software similar to Trello. Currently it's a work in progress.

## Current aim
Have a full working backend API in the newest .NET Core using best practices. More detailed aims are listed in the [Issues](https://github.com/Hakej/HelloTask/issues).

## Possible future
I was thinking about adding some frontend (maybe in Angular), but for now I want to focus on backend.

## Why am I making it
Primarly to learn more advanced aspects of .NET Core and to understand good programming practices.

Secondly - for fun :)
